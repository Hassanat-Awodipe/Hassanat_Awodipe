## In Progress  
*Updated: 02.10.2023* 

I wouldn’t call myself a multi-talented person but over the last twenty years of my life, I have been interested in so many different and maybe contrasting things. I have been a writer, reader, baker, tailor, make-up artist, social-media manager, business owner and most recently, a data analyst. And even when I started with data analytics, I did not intend to go into AI and ML but now, I am finding that interesting too. My defense is that I am allowed to figure out what I  want to do with the rest of my life while in my twenties. And you would agree that I have definitely looked into a lot of options.

Currently, I am studying for my masters in Applied Data Science with a specialisation in Data and Business Analytics at the University of L'Aquila in Italy. Although I live in Germany (and of Nigerian nationality), studying in Italy has given me a different perspective on multilingualism which was what I aimed for early in life. Now, I am just trying to improve my German language competency. I digress.

My experience as an entrepreneur equipped me with the skills to take ownership of processes and identify key metrics for business improvement, and with my analytic skills, I have been able to leverage data to uncover insights for valuable decision-making. 

While working as a data analyst intern, I analysed business data across different departments of the company using MS Excel and SQL. I performed SQL queries ranging from joins, subqueries, CTEs and Window functions to generate concise reports about clients' career growth, according to the company’s reporting standards. I achieved a 90% improvement in speed and accuracy by automating a report for the weekly calculations of metrics.

Passionate about data and being proactive, I once assigned myself a project for a paper production company. I extracted datasets from a reliable source and created a Postgres database to store the data. Then, I established a connection in Power BI and developed a dashboard to tell a story with their sales figures. I also recommended actions for the improvement of sales. I believe this experience of data discovery, identifying insights and creating an interactive dashboard has prepared me for an analyst role.

In addition, I have completed professional courses such as the Google Data Analytics Specialisation which included extensive coursework on R and Tableau, and the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree which included data exploration, data wrangling and data visualisation projects with Python. By taking these courses concurrently, I got skilled at handling multiple tasks and prioritising deadlines while enhancing my skills to recommend data-based business decisions.
