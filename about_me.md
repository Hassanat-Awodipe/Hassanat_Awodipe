## In Progress  
*Updated: 20.09.2021* 

I wouldn’t call myself a multi-talented person but over the last twenty years of my life, I have been interested in so many different and maybe contrasting things. I have been a writer, reader, baker, tailor, make-up artist, social-media manager and most recently, a data analyst. And even when I started with data analytics, I did not intend to go into AI and ML but now, I am finding that interesting too. My defense is that I am allowed to figure out what I  want to do with the rest of my life while in my twenties. And you would agree that I have definitely looked into a lot of options.

My experience as an entrepreneur has equipped me with the skills to take ownership of processes and identify key metrics for business improvement, and with my analytic skills, I have been able to leverage data to uncover insights for valuable decision-making. 

As a data analyst intern, I analysed business data across different departments of the company using MS Excel and SQL. I performed SQL queries ranging from joins, subqueries, CTEs and Window functions to generate concise reports according to the company’s reporting standards. I achieved a 90% improvement in speed and accuracy by automating a report for the weekly calculations of metrics.

Passionate about data and being proactive, I assigned myself a project for a paper production company. I extracted datasets from a reliable source and created a Postgres database to store the data. Then, I established a connection in Power BI and developed a dashboard to tell a story with their sales figures. I also recommended actions for the improvement of sales. I believe this experience of data discovery, identifying insights and creating an interactive dashboard has prepared me for an analyst role.

In addition, I have completed professional courses such as the Google Data Analytics Specialisation which included extensive coursework on R and Tableau, and the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree which included data exploration, data wrangling and data visualisation projects with Python. By taking these courses concurrently for three months, I got skilled at handling multiple tasks and prioritising deadlines while enhancing my skills to recommend data-based business decisions.
