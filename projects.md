## World's GDP Exploration

<img src="images/Average_GDP.png?raw=true"/>

The World's GDP is affected by a variety of economic factors. I examined these factors based on data from 2001 to 2018 using exploratory graphical analysis with Python. Then, I created explanatory visualisations to summarise my findings. You can click [here](/Project1/World_GDP_Presentation.slides.html) to view the slides. 

The full exploration can be found [here](/Project1/World_GDP_Analysis_code.html)

Parch and Posey is a company that deals with the sale of paper. In this analysis, I focused on the three kinds of paper they sell: Standard Paper, Poster Paper and Gloss Paper. You can click [here](/pdf/Sales_dashboard_P&P_10.pdf) for the pdf view of the dashboard created with Power BI.

Top5 Dog breeds by Mean Retweets and Favourites

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The aim of this analysis is to display my proficiency in Data Wrangling by gathering the data of WeRateDogs from multiple sources and in different file formats, assessing for quality and tidiness issues then cleaning. After wrangling, I analysed the data to understand how twitter users react to the tweets of WeRateDogs. The result of the analysis - carried out with Python - can be found [here](/Project2/Analysis_of_WeRateDogs_Tweet-Report.html).

Comparison of Potential and Overall Ratings

Working with a database of European Soccer collected over a period of 9 years (2007 - 2016), I analysed the data to find out how players' attributes affect their overall and potential ratings for the year 2016. I also checked the rate at which the footballers met up to their potential. I used Python for my analysis and the notebook can be found [here](/Project3/Analysis_of_Football_Players_Rating_in_2016.html).
